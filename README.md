# -malware-browser-extension

# Introduction

**Frankie**  was created with the everyday internet user in mind, particularly those who frequently navigate various websites and might encounter malicious sites seeking to steal personal information or infect their systems with malware. Our Chrome extension assists users by assessing the safety of a specific website, leveraging a pre-trained machine learning model to determine whether it is secure for browsing.

# How it Works ?




The ML model extracts the following features from a url :


  
| Feattures     Used                  |                                   |                            |                     |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Having IP address                   | URL Length                        | URL Shortening service     | Having @ symbol     |
| Having double slash                 | Having dash symbol(Prefix Suffix) | Having multiple subdomains | SSL Final State     |  | Domain Registration Length | Favicon | HTTP or HTTPS token in domain name | Request URL |
| URL of Anchor                       | Links in tags                     | SFH - Server from Handler. | Submitting to email |
| Abnormal URL                        | IFrame                            | Age of Domain              | DNS Record          |
| Web Traffic -  using data.alexa.com | Google Index                      |                            Reports |

## What Problem it Solves ?

In today's digital landscape, many websites aim to collect user data by deceiving visitors into revealing their credentials, often for fraudulent purposes or other malicious acts. Unsuspecting users browsing the internet are often unaware of the dangers lurking behind the scenes, potentially exposing themselves to identity theft or malware downloads.

To address this issue, we developed a Chrome extension designed to act as a safeguard between users and malicious websites. This extension helps users determine whether a particular website is safe for browsing, providing a layer of security against deceitful sites. 

Our project was specifically designed with the average internet user in mind, acknowledging the frequent need to visit various websites. This extension ensures that users can navigate the internet more safely, without falling prey to malicious websites that seek to steal information or introduce harmful software into their systems.
